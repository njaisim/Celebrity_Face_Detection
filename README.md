# Celebrity_Face_Detection

This is a classification project using SVM machine learning algorithm. 

In this we have taken 5 sports celebrities images and trained the model after cleaning and preprocessing using OpenCV & Wavelet Transformation.

Model was developed after running multiple algorithms using Gridsearch to find the best suitable model for this classification. For metrics I have used classification reports and accuracy.

Among RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression & SVM, I got maximum accuracy with SVM of 84%.

Then built an basic website using HTML, CSS and Java script and used this model to predict the celebrity name using their images.
